I made this using Kotlin, Coroutines, LiveData, Clean Architecture, MVVM, Hilt, Room, XML

I separated it into several packages to distinct layers

I was able to do it in 4+/- hours summary

If it's needed I can implement both favorites feature, and details caching

Now it works both online and offline, although details are not cached

if you wish to discuss any details or need any more features please let me know
